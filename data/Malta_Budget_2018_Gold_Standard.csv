But Debbie gets 42,000 euro a year worth of 'appointments' solely on her merit of being a Lejburista and formerly in charge of the Lands department!
What about a reduction in energy rates to large industries employing thousands and SMEs who day in, day out become less competitive in domestic and foreign markets? Wasn't that Lejber's cry that, 'without a new power station electricity rates cannot be lowered'? Well, we have the new power station, although truth be told, it is not generating at full capacity unless it is burning air!

536,,N-12,The Malta Independent,"The budget is the occasion for the opposition to distinguish itself from the governing party and projects an alternative.

The difference between the 2 parties is now clear ...Labour under Muscat has abandoned ideological consistency that was an important characteristic over decades since its foundation and is pursuing a populist policy . Boffa, Mintoff, KMB and Alfred Sant - all considered the Labour ideals as central in their policy-making whereas Joseph Muscat has no such scruples.

The PN on the other hand still adheres to nation building as its fundamental underlying principle . This means that Labour has temporary gained a big electoral advantage. However this advantage will not last forever since after a period of time the electorate will realise the short-termism of Labour's policies....booms are followed by bangs and hardship for an increasing minority of people in poverty or in the risk of poverty increases all the time.

It is important that in these new conditions the PN re-generates itself by showing that populism does not offer a solution to the country's problems .... and takes its message to all social classes.....especially to the south of Malta where Labour has built a formidable stronghold . At the same time the Party must try to form alliances with other social groups rather than trying to capture the absolute majority by itself - as it had succeeded to do in the 1980's and 1990's.

In this way, the PN by discarding elitism will offer an alternative government",Neutral,Neutral,Surprise,Surprise,0,0,0,0

Lejber, on the other hand does not deliver the goods promised and earmarked in previous Budgets, in order to create artificial surpluses. So, no EDP is necessary as the burden of not spending for goods and services long overdue, are borne by those who most urgently need them.

However you Sir is falling in the same definition: 'pension equal pensioner'.
In those days I hated to pay my contribution for when I get old. Since that time we came to a stage that a 61 year old new pensioner can still work and get his pension that means his increase is two fold.
However a pensioner in his 80's payed his NI on a government promise that he will receive 2/3 of his pay as pension, finding himself and his spouse depending on others, he has not only to fend for himself and his spouse with the 'same increase' as you ably put it.
